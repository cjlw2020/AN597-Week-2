## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Below i created a vector for the first line of Ulysses

UlyssesFirstLine <- c("Stately", "plump", "Buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed")

# created a matrix to delineate the diffrence between the thrid colloum of words and assigned varriable

m <- matrix(UlyssesFirstLine, nrow = 8, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Extract the 3rd column

col3 <- m[, 3]

# Removed the repeated character "plump" at the end

col4 <- col3[1:7]

# Create 1-80 matrix and extract column 2, 3, 6

y <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)

x <- y[, c(2, 3, 6)]

# Extract rows 6 and 8

x <- y[c(6, 8),]

# Extract elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9
